# Hello-World
An attempt at learning the process flow of Github before I am responsible for actually knowing it.
I am a technical consultant with Deloitte Consulting. My expertise is in the virtual space as well as Wintel, Secuity and public transportation logistics systems. I love learning new tech and processes daily, and pride myself on being a mentor and a student simultaniously.
